## Files
- `mass_error_test.Rmd`: Main R Markdown script
- `.mgf`, `.pin`, `.bat`, `.psms`, `.tsv` files: Input data and scripts used in the pipeline

## Getting Started
The provided code is to demonstrate and provide a reproducible example data for method "Mass Error Test" in an academic journal, 
"Distinguishing N-Terminal Methylation from Near-isobaric Modifications by Statistical Analysis of Mass Error Distributions of Fragment Ions",
currently under revision in JPR.

The example data is methylated BSA standard tryptic digest

To run this analysis, open `mass_error_test.Rmd` in RStudio and follow the steps.
